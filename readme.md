# Outline

The purpose of this project is to outline and explore an implementation of a zero-shot recognition system employing concepts of Direct Attribute Prediction (DAP).

An attempt will be made to optimize the results of the implementation, as well as opening a discussion on how the implementation might be improved to produce a greater accuracy.

A zero-shot recognition system is one that attempts to label image classes unseen by the system in training. To do so, the system requires a labelled training set of classes and the knowledge of how these seen classes are semantically related to the unseen classes, in the form of a predicate matrix 

## Grade
